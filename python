""" Ella, an avid TV show enthusiast, is planning a binge-watching marathon for a new series. She has a specific routine: after watching a set number of episodes, she takes a short break.



She is provided with the following information:

Each episode of the series has a fixed duration of 45 minutes.
After a certain number of episodes, there is a break of 15 minutes.


Ella wants to know the total time she will need to watch the entire series, including the breaks. Your task is to help Ella by calculating the total viewing time.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer E, representing the total number of episodes in the series.

The second line consists of an integer B, representing the number of episodes watched before taking a break.

Output format :
The output prints an integer representing the total viewing time required to watch the entire series, including the breaks."""

total_episodes = int(input())
episodes_before_break = int(input())
episode_duration = 45 # in minutes
break_duration = 15   # in minutes

full_breaks = (total_episodes - 1) // episodes_before_break # Calculate full breaks
remaining_episodes = total_episodes - (full_breaks * episodes_before_break) # Calculate remaining episodes

total_duration = (full_breaks * (episodes_before_break * episode_duration + break_duration) + (remaining_episodes * episode_duration)) * (full_breaks > 0) + (total_episodes * episode_duration) * (full_breaks == 0)

print(f"{total_duration} minutes")
